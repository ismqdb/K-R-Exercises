I've learned C (and programming basics) from the K&R book. This repo is a collection of my solutions to exercises from it, minus the last chapter, which is more concerned with Unix.

They say it's good to have a portfolio, so here we go. I think it will be a good pointer to my knowledge of C and systems programming.
